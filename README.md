# Curator-rater Client

Curator-rater is an image-based social media app. It is based on the idea that a well curated gallery is more effective than a single image or a collection of unconnected images. It allows creatives and tastemakers to share larger ideas in a visual way and get easy feedback at what ideas connect with their audience.

See code for the API [here](https://github.com/StreakInTheSky/curator-rater)
